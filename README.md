# Graphite - Write Succinct Proofs for Graphs easily!

## Value Proposition
 - **ZKPs Accessible via Python:** You can generate succinct proofs for any graph algorithms, easily using just python without knowing any ZKP-domain specific languages
 - **Save gas on contracts:** Create succinct proofs for properties about graphs based on public data, without running the entire computation on gas-expensive smart contracts
 - **Optimizable:** Since each graph algorithm is updated individually, the lower-level implementation can be optimized for each algorithm, and optimized extensively
 

# Getting Started

Try out `demo.ipynb`! Shows you how to create a succinct proof easily in the notebook.
